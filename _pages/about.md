Hello! I am a software engineering graduate who is currently working as a lecturer at [Northern University Bangladesh(NUB)](https://nub.ac.bd/). I have completed my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering with first class with honours from Islamic University of Technology (IUT). 

My research interests include Software Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, AI -Computational Social Science and their real world applications. My undergraduate thesis is titled "An Empirical Study on Neophytes of Stack Overflow: How Welcoming the Community is towards Them". The work falls in the Software Engineering domain under the Human Factor and Social Networks sub-domain. This study aims to validate the unwelcoming and hostile nature of the StackOverflow community toward new users, identify the potential reasons, and provide recommendations for the betterment of the StackOverflow community.During the course of completing this thesis, I acquired hands on experinace on how to find and read literature on a specific domain, how to find gaps in the literature and proposing solutions to bridge that gap. As a contribution to Novel Approaches to System and Software Engineering, my undergraduate thesis has been published as a conference paper in ENASE-2022. Apart from that, an extended version of my undergrad thesis work has been submitted to the Springer Nature CCIS book series 2022, which is currently (as of Feb. 2023) under review. The extended version is focusing on the longevity analysis of new users of StackOverflow to inspect their reaction in adverse situations compared with the regular users.

Currently I am continuing research work in NUB as well as an independent researcher.

I love brainstorming to come up with solutions to complex problems and implementing them using programming languages. During my time as a student, I had participated in several programming contests. I am currently associated with training sophomore and junior year studnets in NUB for competative programming.
