collection: publications
permalink: /publications/towards
excerpt: 'Stack Overflow (SO) is the most popular knowledge sharing platform for novice to experienced programmers. It is growing gradually with its rapidly expanding community of new users. However, the hostile environment towards new users is a burning issue for several years, which hinders the enhancement of a skillful community. In this research, we study a subset of users who are either registered in the last 45 days or have a reputation less than or equal to 50 and term them as “neophytes”. We study if neophytes experience unwelcoming environment when cooperating on Stack Overflow, if so, determine the potential reasons behind this problem and determine how much adverse situation affects neophytes activity. According to our findings, neophytes do face difficulty while cooperating on the platform. The causes for the difficulties include deleting or closing of posts, no answer to the post, rude comments etc. Moreover, the activeness of regular users are found to be 6.71 times more than the neophytes who face adverse situation. It depicts that facing adverse situation reduce the activeness of neophytes. The study is an initiative to address the problems and pathway to maintain a friendly environment for all. The findings of our research study can be used to develop guidance in making the Stack Overflow community more user-friendly as well as aid researchers in future studies to improve the Stack Overflow environment.'
